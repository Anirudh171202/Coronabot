{'What should i do to protect myself from corona': {'answer': "Do: Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub Cover your nose and mouth  with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell Don't: Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean", 'source': 'https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public'}, 'How do i know if i have corona': {'answer': 'Common symptoms include:       fever       tiredness       dry cough.      Other symptoms include:       shortness of breath       aches and pains       sore throat       and very few people will report diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose', 'source': 'https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_3'}, 'Should i be tested for COVID-19': {'answer': 'Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.', 'source': 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html'}, 'where can i be tested for COVID-19': {'answer': 'The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.', 'source': 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html'}, 'what should i do if there is an outbreak in my community': {'answer': '  During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work. Follow the steps below:  Protect yourself and others.      Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close contact with others as much as possible (about 6 feet).  Put your household plan into action.      Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area, as this may affect your household’s daily routine.      Continue practicing everyday preventive actions. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular household detergent and water.     Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule changes. Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.     Stay in touch with others by phone or email. If you have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and health care providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family and friends, especially those at increased risk of developing severe illness, such as older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions.

If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.', 'source': 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html'}, 'Are symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than adults': {'answer': 'No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.', 'source': 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#conditions'}, 'What should i do if i had close contact with someone who has COVID-19': {'answer': 'There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.', 'source': 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html'}, 'is it ok if i donate blood to patients': {'answer': 'In healthcare settings all across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.', 'source': 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#conditions'}, 'can i recieve international packages during this time?': {'answer': 'There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged COVID-19 and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. ', 'source': 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html'}, 'why are we seeing a rise in cases of COVID-19': {'answer': 'The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country. The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread. More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.', 'source': 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html'}, 'what conditions kill COVID-19?': {'answer': 'Research has already shown that Sars-Cov-2 can survive for up to 72 hours on hard surfaces like plastic and stainless steel at temperatures of between 21-23C (70-73F) and in relative humidity of 40%. Exactly how the Covid-19 virus behaves at other temperatures and humidity has still to be tested, but research on other coronaviruses suggests they can survive for more than 28 days at 4C. (Read more about how long Covid-19 can survive on surfaces.)  A closely related coronavirus that caused the Sars outbreak in 2003 has also been found to survive best in cooler, drier conditions. For example, dried Sars virus on smooth surfaces remained infectious for over five days at between 22-25C and with a relative humidity of 40-50%. The higher the temperature and humidity, the shorter the virus survived.', 'source': 'https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200323-coronavirus-will-hot-weather-kill-covid-19'}}

When soap comes into contact with these fatty substances, it binds with them and causes them to disconnect from the virus. It also forces the virus to disengage from the skin.  You do have to be vigorous with your hand-washing though. That’s why the advice is that hands should be washed thoroughly for at least 20 seconds.', 'source': 'https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/coronavirus-soap-covid-19-virus-hygiene/'}, 'Does lack of sleep increase my vulnerability of contacting COVID-19': {'answer': "During deep sleep your body makes cytokines, a type of protein that targets viral infections, creating and coordinating a powerful immune response.  Cytokines are both produced and released during deep sleep, causing a double whammy if you don't get enough.  Lack of sleep (and stress) will also suppress the production of infection-fighting antibodies, which are vital for combating viruses.

Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily.

Viruses that cause illnesses such as COVID-19 and the seasonal flu are often spread via direct exposure to respiratory droplets expelled in the sneezes or coughs of a sick person, but they can also live on surfaces and inanimate objects for days at a time.

There is a unique challenge for food delivery couriers who are potentially traveling between multiple sites: from restaurants and from house to house. Especially if they are making deliveries to families who are in quarantine because they’ve tested positive for the infection. Given the number of people they see daily, the deliverers are probably among those at greatest risk of exposure, so they do need to be careful.

Once or twice a day should do the trick to remove germs, but if someone in your house is sick, you may want to wipe down surfaces more frequently. After you wipe the area, let it air dry to give it time to kill any bacteria that could linger. https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-help-kill-coronavirus-in-your-house-and-car-after-youve-gone-outside/", 'source': 'https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-help-kill-coronavirus-in-your-house-and-car-after-youve-gone-outside/'}}

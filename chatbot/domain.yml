  utter_coronavirusaffectedmajor:
  - text: Over 25,000 people have died from COVID-19, as the illness is officially known, while more than 551,000 infections have been confirmed in at least 170 countries and territories. More than 127,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus. Italy, USA, and China are the 3 most affected countries.
  utter_mortaliltywhatrate:
  - text: The current mortality rate of COVID-19 is 0.05% (26,908 deaths for 587718 infected)
  utter_likelycatchhow:
  - text: The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Its important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.
  utter_developingriskwho:
  - text: While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others. 
  utter_catchfrompet:
  - text: While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. 
  utter_survivelongdoes:
  - text: According to a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can live in the air and on surfaces between several hours and several days. The study found that the virus is viable for up to 72 hours on plastics, 48 hours on stainless steel, 24 hours on cardboard, and 4 hours on copper. It is also detectable in the air for three hours.
  utter_contractsymptomsshould:
  - text: Please contact healthcare services immediately and get tested. 
  utter_precautionsqaurantinetaken:
  - text: You have been in close contact with someone who has Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and even though you feel well now, it is possible that you are also infected. It can take 2 - 14 days to show symptoms, so we may not know for up to 14 days if you are infected or not. You have been asked to self-quarantine in case you are infected so that you dont pass on the infection to anyone else. It may turn out that you are not infected but it is too soon to tell.
  utter_protectshouldmyself:
  - text: Do Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub Cover your nose and mouth  with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell Don't Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean
  utter_knowhavehow:
  - text: Common symptoms include       fever       tiredness       dry cough.      Other symptoms include       shortness of breath       aches and pains       sore throat       and very few people will report diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose
  utter_hydroxychloroquinecureis:
  - text: Recently, there has been considerable discussion of whether two related drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that have been available for decades to treat other illnesses might also be effective in treating COVID-19. The drugs are primarily used to treat malaria and several inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) and rheumatoid arthritis. No drug is perfectly safe, but these drugs are quite safe when used for just the several days they might be needed to treat COVID-19. They are also cheap, already available at our local drug stores, and relatively free of side effects. The question, of course, is whether they are effective against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Are they effective in killing the virus in a laboratory dish? And are they effective in killing the virus in people? If the answer to the first question is no, there's no point in getting an answer to the second question. There is strong evidence that both drugs kill the COVID-19 virus in the laboratory dish. The drugs appear to work through two mechanisms. First, they make it harder for the virus to attach itself to the cell, inhibiting the virus from entering the cell and multiplying within it. Second, if the virus does manage to get inside the cell, the drugs kill it before it can multiply. But do the drugs work in people with COVID-19? Many studies are underway to get an answer to this question, but as of March 24, 2020, only two have issued preliminary results. One report, published in February 2020, claimed that chloroquine had been used in more than 100 patients in China who had COVID-19. The scientists stated that their results demonstrated that chloroquine is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the worsening of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, eliminating the virus from the body, and shortening the duration of the disease. These claims are exciting. However, the report provided virtually no evidence in support of the claims. First of all, this was not a randomized, double-blind controlled trial, the gold standard for research studies. Second, no evidence was presented as to how severe the pneumonia was, nor whether findings on lung x-rays or CT scans really improved. Third, although they claim the drug made the virus disappear, they didn't report what the levels of the virus were before versus after the treatment. In short, not much evidence. Another small study was conducted by a group of scientists in southern France, a region hard hit by COVID-19. This, also, was not a randomized trial. Instead, the scientists compared 26 patients who received hydroxychloroquine to 16 who did not after six days, the virus was gone from the body in 70% of those given the treatment, compared to only 12.5% of those who weren't. The drug appeared to be as effective in the sickest patients as in the least sick, but the study was too small to be sure about that. The study also was too small to say that people who received the treatment were protected against a prolonged illness or death. There are many studies underway, and we should have more solid answers within a few months.
  utter_spreaddoeshow:
  - text: The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.     Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).     Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
  utter_outsidesafeis:
  - text: In general, running, walking, and biking solo or with your immediate household can be done with minimal risk of catching or spreading the virus. But sports performed in groups and involving physical contact are a no-go. Miller says to remember that the virus can be spread by direct contact or by touching the same objects. When considering an activity, think about how close youll be to others and whether you'll be touching the same things. The more often a ball or other piece of sports equipment is touched by someone other than yourself, the more risk you're introducing for disease spread. If your go-to sport has too many uncertainties to make a clear call say, not knowing if it will be possible to maintain distance at a particular trail or park it's better to be conservative and don't go. If you've satisfied all the above precautions and are ready to go, wash your hands before you go out, says Grace Roberts, a virologist at Queen's University Belfast.You don't know if you're infected. Also, bring everything you need water, snacks, etc.so that you can minimize having to stop at any stores. Don't use public restrooms or other shared facilities. Then, when you're out, avoid touching surfaces with your hands and keep your hands away from your face. For example, you might use your elbow to hit a crosswalk button. Roberts says that when she's running, she reserves her left hand for hitting the crosswalk button or any other surfaces, while her right hand is used for adjusting her glasses, or handling water and snacks. Once you get home, immediately wash your hands.
  utter_humansspreadthis:
  - text: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
  utter_shouldtestedfor:
  - text: Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
  utter_testedwherecan:
  - text: The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
  utter_communityoutbreakshould:
  - text:   During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work. Follow the steps below  Protect yourself and others.      Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close contact with others as much as possible (about 6 feet).  Put your household plan into action.      Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area, as this may affect your households daily routine.      Continue practicing everyday preventive actions. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular household detergent and water.     Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule changes. Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.     Stay in touch with others by phone or email. If you have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and health care providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family and friends, especially those at increased risk of developing severe illness, such as older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions. 
  utter_cleaningproductsprotect:
  - text: Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.  If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
  utter_differentsymptomschildren:
  - text: No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
  utter_contactsomeoneshould:
  - text: There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
  utter_patientsdonateblood:
  - text: In healthcare settings all across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.
  utter_internationalpackagesrecieve:
  - text: There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged COVID-19 and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we dont know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. 
  utter_seeingcasesrise:
  - text: The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country. The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread. More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
  utter_conditionscovid19what:
  - text: Research has already shown that Sars-Cov-2 can survive for up to 72 hours on hard surfaces like plastic and stainless steel at temperatures of between 21-23C (70-73F) and in relative humidity of 40%. Exactly how the Covid-19 virus behaves at other temperatures and humidity has still to be tested, but research on other coronaviruses suggests they can survive for more than 28 days at 4C. (Read more about how long Covid-19 can survive on surfaces.)  A closely related coronavirus that caused the Sars outbreak in 2003 has also been found to survive best in cooler, drier conditions. For example, dried Sars virus on smooth surfaces remained infectious for over five days at between 22-25C and with a relative humidity of 40-50%. The higher the temperature and humidity, the shorter the virus survived.

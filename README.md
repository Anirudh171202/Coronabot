## Problem Statement ##

With the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a significant rise in misinformation among the general public. For example, in Iran, 300 people lost their lives after ingesting toxic substances in the belief that it would treat the infection. 

The World Health Organization (WHO) referred to COVID-19 as an "infodemic" with fake news and misinformation affecting more people across the world than even the virus itself.

To help prevent this, we present our solution: a method to fact-check information with certified sources on COVID-19.

## Solution ##

A user interfaces with a chatbot to gain and validate information about the epidemic. Data from certified and curated sources (such as National Health Services and the WHO) are scraped into a database. Data pertaining to the query is then sent to the bot and displayed to the user with the appropriate links.
